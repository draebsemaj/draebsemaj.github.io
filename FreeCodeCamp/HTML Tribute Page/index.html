                <p>Have you ever heard of Dwarf Fortress? It’s a computer game that has been in development for over 20 years! The project grew from a previous game, and is created and maintained by Zach and Tarn Adams.  When you first encounter Dwarf Fortress, you’re prompted to generate a starting world. This process generates continents, oceans, civilizations, and a history of the world spanning decades of centuries. Did I mention that this is all procedurally generated? </p>
                <p>Generating a world is the first step, but the meat of the game is in the creation of a team of dwarven colonists and their supplies on a mission to set up a new colony. But the world is not unilaterally friendly to dwarves, and it’s quite possible that you’ll find your efforts opposed by thieving monkeys, rampaging goblins, or ravenous lemurs! Indeed, the better question might be what isn’t trying to kill you in Dwarf Fortress. </p>
                <p>I admire greatly how this game exists in a space between simplicity and complexity. The graphics rely on letters, colors, and symbols to represent units, resources, and terrain. There’s a singular music track that plays throughout the game. And the only narrative you’ll find is the one you bring with you. But the sheer amount of variables and combinations at play give a type of complexity that borders on the surreal. For instance, at one point in its development, cats began to die of alcohol poisoning because they were picking up spilled alcohol on the floor through a combination of a footprint program and a grooming subroutine for cats. </p>
                <p>Now recognized as the creators’ life long project, we may never see a ‘finished’ version of Dwarf Fortress. Adams has mentioned that it may take another 20 years to get to a version 1.0. But, as long as the donations continue to come in on this fan funded project, hopefully we’ll be able to strive towards that finished vision.</p>
